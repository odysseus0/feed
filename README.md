# feed

RSS gives you the content you chose, not what an algorithm chose. But 92 feeds produce 2600 entries a week, and you can't read them all.

`feed` is a headless RSS engine that lets an AI agent read your feeds for you — your own algorithm.

```bash
brew install odysseus0/tap/feed
feed import hn-popular-blogs-2025.opml         # 92 curated tech blogs

# Install the agent skill, then just ask
npx skills add odysseus0/feed
claude "read my RSS feeds and surface what's worth reading today"
```

The agent fetches your feeds, scans titles, reads the interesting ones in full, and presents a digest — grouped by theme, with summaries of why each post matters.

Single Go binary. Local SQLite database you can query directly. No server, no daemon, no UI. Just structured data out of stdout, ready for agents and scripts.

```bash
# It's just a SQLite file — bring your own queries
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/feed/feed.db "SELECT title, url FROM entries ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 10"
```

## Install

```bash
brew install odysseus0/tap/feed
```

Or with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/odysseus0/feed/cmd/feed@latest
```

Includes a starter OPML with [92 popular tech blogs](hn-popular-blogs-2025.opml) curated from Hacker News discussions.

### Agent skill

`feed` ships with an agent skill that teaches your coding agent the full digest workflow:

```bash
npx skills add odysseus0/feed
```

Then ask your agent to read your feeds — it handles fetching, triaging, reading, and summarizing autonomously.

OpenClaw 🦞: `npx clawhub@latest install rss-digest` — dependency auto-install included.

## Usage

```bash
# Add a feed (auto-discovers feed URL from any webpage)
feed add feed https://simonwillison.net

# Fetch all feeds (or just one by ID)
feed fetch
feed fetch 42

# Browse entries
feed get entries                    # unread, newest first
feed get entries --status all       # everything
feed get entries --feed 1 -o json   # one feed, as JSON

# Read a full post (rendered as Markdown)
feed get entry 446

# Search across everything
feed search "rust async"

# Triage
feed update entry 446 --read
feed update entry 446 --starred
feed update entries --read 100 101 102 103   # batch

# Manage feeds
feed get feeds              # list all with unread counts
feed remove feed 42
feed import feeds.opml
feed export > backup.opml

# Stats
feed get stats
```

### Output modes

Every command supports `-o table` (default), `-o json`, or `-o wide`. Status messages go to stderr, data to stdout — pipe-friendly by design.

## Why this exists

Platform algorithms are optimized for the platform — engagement, ads, time on site. An LLM you run locally is optimized for you. RSS got you off the content treadmill. `feed` + an agent gives you control back.

Newsboat, miniflux, and NetNewsWire are readers. This is plumbing. They have UIs; this has clean table output for agents and structured data for scripts. `feed` is the missing layer between RSS and whatever you want to do with it — LLM triage, vault ingestion, notification pipelines, or scripts you haven't written yet.

Bring your own algorithm.

## How it works

- **Feed discovery** — `feed add https://example.com` parses `<link rel="alternate">` tags. No need to find the feed URL yourself.
- **Concurrent fetching** — 10 workers by default with conditional requests (ETag/If-Modified-Since). Polite and fast.
- **Pre-computed Markdown** — HTML content is converted to Markdown at fetch time. `feed get entry <id>` renders instantly.
- **Full-text search** — SQLite FTS5 across titles, summaries, and content.
- **Auto-fetch on staleness** — `feed get entries` fetches automatically if feeds are >30min stale. Skip with `--no-fetch`.
- **Batch state management** — Mark 50 entries as read in one command. Essential for agent triage workflows.

## Configuration

`feed` works out of the box with sane defaults. Optional config via `~/.config/feed/config.toml` or environment variables.

| Setting | Env var | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Database path | `FEED_DB_PATH` | `~/.local/share/feed/feed.db` |
| Staleness threshold | `FEED_STALE_MINUTES` | `30` |
| Fetch workers | `FEED_FETCH_CONCURRENCY` | `10` |
| Retention (days) | `FEED_RETENTION_DAYS` | `0` (keep all) |
| HTTP timeout | `FEED_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `20` |

Precedence: CLI flags > env vars > config file > defaults.

## Origin

Inspired by [Karpathy's RSS revival tweet](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2018043254986703167) (Feb 2026): "download a client, or vibe code one." We vibe coded the headless engine for agents.

## Development

```bash
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

Pure Go, no CGO. `go install` works on any platform.
